If you’re wondering which House is storming the Yard in green bikinis and tiny Speedos, it’s Currier, and they’ll make sure you know it. Many Currierites have immense House pride—House rankings what?—and easily laugh off any disparaging remarks made about their beloved home. They know that Currier is probably not anyone’s first choice, but sophomores quickly learn to love, fear, or at least respect the tree—Timete Arboreum, or Fear the Tree, is the House slogan. There are plenty of reasons to love Currier, from its solarium suites to its tight-knit community.
